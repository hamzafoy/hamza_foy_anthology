### What is this website?

I start with a confession. I prepared my first portfolio with haste since I felt both eager to share my progress and excited to build a platform for potential clients & employers to learn about me. With this first portfolio deployed, I understood that I can be more methodical and intentional with *Portfolio 2.0*.

If I could point to a *virtue* that good developers should abide by; I'd point to the very act of improving on things done. We should like to look back at past applications or sites and observe our improvements, the newly learned syntax or framework or paradigm, and be encouraged to continue our learning and the honing of our development  skills.

I intend to be a lot more thorough with this portfolio and make it a true labor of love and demonstrable ability.
